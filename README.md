# Teaching
Welcome to my GitHub repository, a virtual hub where I curate and share a diverse range of resources from my classes, presentations, and videos. 

In this repository, I have curated a diverse range of materials aimed at aiding others in enhancing their understanding and knowledge of different topics. I encourage you to browse through these resources and uncover fresh insights, and please don't hesitate to share your thoughts and feedback with me.

I'm excited to share my collection of videos [[for now videos are just in Persian]] with you! You can watch them on both Aparat and YouTube by clicking on the links below. I hope you find these videos informative and useful, and please don't hesitate to provide your feedback:
