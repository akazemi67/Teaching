# WindowsInternalsCourse
**Contains slides and codes for my Persian videos about Windows internals.**

I love to dig deep into Operating Systems internals and figure out how things work. I am also interested in Programming and enjoy experiencing first-hand how different concepts are implemented.
Therefore, I decided to combine the best of both worlds and write simple programs for explaining a concept and then show how we can examine it and understand the intricacies with internal tools.

To help other enthusiasts like myself, I decided to record videos in my mother tongue AKA “Persian,” and publish them on “aparat.com.”
